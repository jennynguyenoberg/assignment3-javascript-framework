## Assignment: Build first personal project

- [X] Create new GitHub Repo
- [X] Build you idea and style from week 1
- [X] Make sure there is some kind of interactivity on your site. I.e something that would require JavaScript on a regular HTML, CSS, js-site.
- [X] Make sure your choice of design style is well reflected on your site. Preferably "pixel perfect".
- [X] Give credit towards the style you picked. Somewhere on your site provide a mention and a link to where you found the style.
- [X] Use the build function in vite to make your site ready for production.
- [X] Publish your site. You can use GitHub pages or one of the other ways of publishing that I'll show this week (Netlify or Vercel).
- [X] Make sure to commit and push latest to GitHub repo.

### Styling of First Personal React Project
**Idea:** My idea for this project was to create a simple pomodoro timer, using React with hooks such as ```useState``` and ```useEffect```. <br>
**Design:** I didn't aim for a pixel perfect design this time around since it got a bit complicated and didn't really fit the purpose, but I used the style as general inspiration by using a left aligned grid, a sans serif and the same primary colors.
